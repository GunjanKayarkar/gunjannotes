The above article tells how to run specific applications with a specific theme. Basically everytime you want to run codeblocks, run it from the terminal using the command:  GTK\_THEME=Yaru codeblocks  

This will basically  run the application using Yaru theme, but you cant exit the terminal till it is running. 

Also, use CTRL+Scroll up to zoom in Code editor and use SHIFT+"+" key to zoom into the opened codeblocks terminal. REmember to use the NUMPAD "+" key, that one which is long, on the RHS numpad. This is just a temporary solution, the permanent solution is to start using VS Code. Also, this method will have to be repeated again and again, if you want to make this change permanent, instructions are given in the above link itself
