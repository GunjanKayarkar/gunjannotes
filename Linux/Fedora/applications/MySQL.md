**FOR FEDORA**

After you have installed the MySQL server on ubuntu, make sure that you have setup your password, also make sure that your default user is root and it has the permissions to access all the databases and perform operations on them.

Now to start the service you use “sudo systemctl start mysqld” command. To stop the server you use “sudo systemctl stop mysqld” command. Either ways, whenever you want to check whether the server is running or not, you use the “sudo systemctl status mysqld” command. To exit the thing that has opened after this status command, use the ‘q’ key. Also remember that the service mysql status command basically gives like a log of whatever happened last 5-6 times with the service “mysql” so you look it from there. After you have started the server, you use the following command to login to the root user, which is basically the ‘root’@’localhost’. The command is “mysql -u root -p” after this command you are prompted to enter the password. This command basically means that, MySQL then dash U means user, then name of user is root and then dash P means password which you are prompted to enter in the next step, after this, your terminal gets converted into a mysql command line, go use it now.
