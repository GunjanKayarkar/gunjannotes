# **GoLang** 
fmt.printf("") is for printing 



fmtscan(&alpha) is for scanning and storing it at alpha 



var x int = 1 and i:=1 are both ways of writing i=1 



\* Operator returns data while & Operator returns Address 



Lets say you have declared a 16 bit integer as follows 

var x int16 = 1 

var y int32 = 2 

NOW if here you want to turn int16 to int32, then write 

x = int32(y) 



Similarly there is the float32 and float64, while float32 supports upto 6 digit decimals, float64 supports 15. 

Also, complex128 for Complex Numbers
