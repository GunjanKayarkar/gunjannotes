7zip basically secures the archived files. It can only apply its AES256 encryption on the files/folders that it has archived/compressed, so everytime it decompresses a file, there is a situation that it dumps an unencrypted copy of the file in the Windows Temporary directory. Also, it only works with Archive files. So there are these two shortcomings of 7Zip
