# **Bootstrap**

Basically bootstrap is a bunch of css and js files, from where you can just copy paste code of components and use them in your projects. Now, you might think that this way all bootstrap based sites must be looking the same, but that isnt the case, you can also add an external css file just below the bootstrap css files, and override whatever changes you want in your own code. So basically if you have copied code for a "primary-danger colored button" which makes a red button via bootstrap, you can define "primary-danger" as blue in your own css file, and it will override it, similarly you can also override the transition, hover,e tc as per your convenience

Bootstrap follows a 12 column grid system, so if you want two particular elements to each occuply 50% of the space, then you give both of them col-6 dimension ie either occupies 6 units worth of space of the 12. There are a lot of classes that can be given to elements in bootstrap unlike css where you need to write a lot of stuff. For example there are dedicated classes for centering items in bootstrap, you just allot the class to your element and boom it gets in the center as opposed to how you do it in vanilla css.
