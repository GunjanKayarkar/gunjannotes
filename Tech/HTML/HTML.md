In sublime text or most advanced text editors, just typing in <html> and selecting it from auto prediction will give you the whole format of an ideal html document. 

But if you want to do manually, then first type !DOCTYPE html and then html then head , then title, then body. It is the usual format 



Headings tag range from h1 to h6 



<a href="<https://google.com>"> Click here to go to google </a> encapsulates the "click here to go to google" text with the[ ](http://www.google.com/)[www.google.com](http://www.google.com/) link. But that will open in the same tab so to make it open in a new tab, use this : <a href="<https://google.com>" target="\_blank"> Click here to go to google </a> 





<div> are BLOCK elements while <span> are INLINE elements
