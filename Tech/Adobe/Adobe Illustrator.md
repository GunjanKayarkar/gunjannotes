This particular shortcuts work for photoshop as well, holding down space bar changes the tool to hand tool and then you can easily navigate using the mouse. Similarly, holding down the Alt key enables the zooming in/out option and so by holding the alt key, you can zoom in and out using just the scroll wheel 



The shift key helps to do many different things in illustrator, like drawing an circle using the ellipse tool, for resizing properly, etc ad many other things 



Mostly keep the scale corners and the scale strokes & effects options enabled for better scaling

While resizing stuff, if you dont want to resize or change all parts of a figure, then click on that particular dot concerning with the part that you want to resize or change, then the dot changes to a dark color or something like that and when you resize using that dot, then only that particular part changes its dimensions. If there are a total 4 dimensions, for example that of a rectangle, and you want to change only 2, then click on 1st one's dot and then hold shift and click on 2nd one's dot, now only those two will resize when you try doing it 



There is the outline and gpu preview modes in the View section 



Shape builder tool used to join two basic shapes and clicking alt and using makes it separate/delete the two basic shapes. BUT REMEMBER that you need to SELECT all those things/shapes first. Similarly, if the shape builder tool is enabled for many overlapping shapes, you can just pick a FILL color and one tap different objects for coloring 



There is a reflect option in OBJECT>TRANSFORM>reflect for just mirror copying stuff 



We have the curvature tool for drawing irregular curves, but if you want to draw straight lines by hand, then still you can use the curvature tool, but between every two points, you will need to use alt to get a new anchor point, otherwise the curves will go mad. You can also double click for getting straight lines. And if you dont want to end the loop and just terminate the drawing somewhere but dont know where to put off the last part, use the escape key 



Pen tool is QUITE tricky too use since you need that assumption of where it will land, but REMEMBER, end points for straight lines and middle points for curvatures using the PEN tool. For resizing shapes of pen tool, use the anchor point option from pen tool interface. 



Pencil tool is just like a hand/mouse moven stylus thing and double clicking on it obviously opens up the tools' settings and there if fidelity is set to max i.e. smooth, then the pencil's lines come out like apsara extra smooth pencil gliding through butter 



Brushes are well brushes and you can use more brushes from the WINDOW>BRUSHES section or even the BRUSH LIBRARIES section at the same place, down below 



Color themes option is gold for noobs like you. 



Gradient option from the color panel on RHS can help you create custom gradients of 2 or even more colors by putting the arrow head at the wanted color. Essentially, just choose one gradient color from the 3-4 options provided at the end of normal color panel and then the Gradient Customize option pops up, use that and boom 



If while clicking on objects, one singular object isn't being selected and the whole rectangle gets selected, try ungrouping all the stuff or even try just select the whole rectangle, and then right click and select "isolate selected clipping mask" 



Typed text cannot be treated as objects, so to make that happen, select the text, and click on TYPE > CREATE OUTLINES. There is also the lesser known warp tool that you can use from the hidden/extra tools option for applying liquify and similar effects. Similarly, there are the Twirl, plucker, scallon, crystallize tool etc as well. Just remember to enable the create outline option first from TYPE section for the selected text 



Learn to use the panels from the topmost toolbar effectively, such as WARP. Now REMEMBER that once the WARP, lets say for example FLAG option is selected, then to fix that effect now, select the EXPAND APPEARANCE option from the OBJECT PANEL at top 



From the WINDOW panel, select the PATTERN OPTIONS option and select create patterns option to make patterns from selected objects. As sson as you open the PATTERN OPTIONS, everything might be greyed our, so see the dark greyish arrow like button to the right, there, on selecting you will get the MAKE PATTERNS option. Once created, that pattern should be available from the Fill COlor section at the right, after the solid color and gradient color options 



In the QUICK OPTIONS to the RHS, there are many options in the IMAGE TRACE section for vectorization of a raster image such as 3 colors, 6 colors, etc. Then click on the EXPAND IMAGE option there on the right to turn the picsart level image to aillustrator level vector. That vectorization process is what many creators use for creating their Vector Arts from photos 



If there are multiple logos on your screen and you want to export all of them individually in the form of individual png logos, then select EXPORT ASSETS option from the WINDOW panel 





WHILE FILLING COLOR IN LOGOS/SHAPES:

First make a rectangle of that color, then Open "Pathfinder" from Window Panel and select both rectangle and shape, and select the Merge option from pathfinder window, then select the option to Isolate Selected Group for the unwanted rectangle part, then just delete the unwanted part and you are done.


You can use the Trace Image feature to convert low quality raster images into vectors, then export as 600dpi PSD, then export the image from this PSD. The only downside being that this doesnt work always as expected, many times you might get images that are high quality but have a water colory effect to them
