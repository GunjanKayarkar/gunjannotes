This particular shortcuts work for photoshop as well, holding down space bar changes the tool to hand tool and then you can easily navigate using the mouse. Similarly, holding down the Alt key enables the zooming in/out option and so by holding the alt key, you can zoom in and out using just the scroll wheel

Many and most things are available through the Window section of photoshop, you just have to enable it from there 



For free transforming, if free transforming is enabled, hold down shift and then transform otherwise it will stay rigid as usual. Similarly, shift is just for transforming the borders, if you use alt, ctrl etc then you can change the perspective or many other things as well 



multiple single layers can be turned into a big one layer for easy moving by clicking the link icon in the RHS panel at the bottom, similarly there is also the option to group many layers in one group folder there itself. while linking/unlinking is temporary, you can just merge them to make a permanent one 



keep an eye on the contiguous, all layers, etc settings on the top toolbar while selecting stuff. Also, clicking ctrl when selected changes the tool to minus tool, which essentially subtracts stuff that you dont want from the autoselection while on the other hand, clicking shift turns the tool into add tool, for adding selections. MAgnetic lasso tool is wonderful. 



Use the SELECT option from top and in that adjust the color range option for auto selecting images having Hairs and other minute stuff quite properly 



While using the CloneStamp or similar tool, remember that you have to hold down Alt key to select the source texture to copy
