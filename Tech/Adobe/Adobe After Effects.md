ctrl+shift+D for cut splitting at anchor point 



click T for togggling opacity option 



holding shift while using pen tool makes straight line 



use actived cinema 4D as 3D renderer instead of Classic 3D and remember to add New --> Light  effect everytime so that the 3D looks better 



"write on" effect is also good 



in effects and presets section-->animation presets--> there is BACKGROUNDs which can be used to get inbuilt backgrounds instead of regular black screen 



audio effect and audio spectrum options from Effects section 



similarly, KEYLIGHT and other similar effects with names related to "KEY" are used for green screen / chroma key 



animation-->trackmotion
